    <p><strong>Transitioning to Cybersecurity with 17 Years of Expertise in Digital Communication</strong></p>

    <p>With a strong foundation in Marketing and Brand Communication, I bring 17 years of experience as a passionate digital communication professional. Now, I am channeling this expertise toward cybersecurity, a field that fascinates me with its focus on Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am actively pursuing certifications and expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity, leveraging my prior experience to navigate and excel in this dynamic domain. My career journey includes working with leading multinational agencies, particularly within WPP organizations such as Asdaâ€™a BCW and Hill+Knowlton Strategies.</p>

    <p>I have had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse array of blue-chip companies and governmental entities, including IBM (SBM), Aramco, KAEC, JCCI, Microsoft, Qualcomm, the Ministry of Health, and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition. This background equips me with a unique perspective and transferable skills that are shaping my transition into the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
